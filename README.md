# Workday Scheduler
## About
This project creates a website that has time blocks to create a schedule. The current day will be displayed in the calendar, with time blocks for standard business hours, color coded to indicate whether the given time is in the past, present, or future. The user can click on a timeblock to create an event and save it into local storage.
